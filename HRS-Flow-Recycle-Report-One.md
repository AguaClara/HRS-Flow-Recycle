## Abstract
Previous High Rate Sedimentation (HRS) teams have observed that at higher upflow velocities, the floc blanket is much more dense at the top of the recirculator than at the bottom. Because of this, they have hypothesized that installing a recycle line from the top of the recirculator to the bottom of the recirculator will improve floc blanket longevity and increase overall reactor performance. The Fall 2018 team has run a baseline experiments, and has begun to fabricate the flow recycle system. In the future, the team will test the recycle system at varying angles of entry into the recirculator and at various upflow velocities.

## Introduction
Sedimentation is the process through which coagulated contaminant particles are removed from water via gravitational settling. In a sedimentation tank, water flows upward as the flocs settle downward. Those flocs settle into a "floc blanket" at the bottom of the sedimentation tank. A floc blanket is defined as a fluidized bed of suspended solids with a high rate of collisions. The particles in the floc blanket begin as small, particles continue to collide with coagulant particles and other flocs,  they clump together into heavier and heavier flocs that will settle into the basin of the recirculator. This process cleans the water, resulting in a lower effluent NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit, a measure of clarity).

In the AguaClara lab, the sedimentation tank's plate settlers are simulated by section of plastic PVC piping called the tube settler. The secion of tube wherein the floc blanket forms is referred to as the "recirculator" by the HRS teams. Since the behavior of a section of fluid is representative of the entire tank, tubing can be used to simulate a simple pathway in the reactor. This allows for a practical method of experimentation on a smaller scale. See figure 1 for a visual comparison of the sedimentation tank in an AguaClara plant to the sedimentation tank in lab.

The HRS teams aim to design a tank that will yield an effluent of no more than 0.3 NTU while maintaining high upflow velocity. Operating at a higher upflow velocity will allow us to process more water in a given period of time, which will decrease plant operating costs. However, when operating at a high upflow velocity in lab, the floc blanket is unstable. The floc blanket is dense near the top of the recirculator, but very thin near the bottom. HRS: Flow Recycle hopes to remediate this issue by installing a recycle line. This will allow future teams to continue researching the potential viability of high upflow velocities in AguaClara plants.

## Literature Review and Previous Work
Several past researchers have studied the process of sedimentation and the properties floc blankets. Their research gives valuable insight to the Fall 2018 HRS: Flow Recycle. Culp et al. (1968) research different angles to find the optimal slope of the tube settlers. Using normal laboratory conditions, a 60 degree angle with respect to the horizontal provided continuous sludge removal while showing effective sedimentation performance. This information was used by the Fall 2017 team when designing the tube settler currently being used by the Fall 2018 team.

Hurst (2010) noted that the presence of the floc blanket enhanced the removal of particles. Their experiments found that upflow velocities of 1.0 to 1.3 m/s produced the best performance. Past HRS teams have been successful at establishing floc blankets at higher velocities than the range given by Hurst, but those floc blankets were not stable.

Swetland (2014) discovered that as larger flocs formed in the sedimentation tank, those flocs would settle due to their high density relative to the fluid. Additionally, they discovered that in order for particle removal to occur, flocs need to have a higher settling velocity than the capture velocity. As the flocs concentrate and fall to the bottom of the sedimentation tank, a floc blanket forms. These findings informed the High Rate Sedimentation teams' understanding of a floc formation.

In a similar vein, Balwan (2016) explored how the length of the tube settlers effected effluent turbidity. He found that increasing the length of tube settler increased the amount of particles removed by the reactor. With tube settlers at an angle of 45 degrees and 60 cm length, turbidity removal was measured to be 80 percent. However, his experiments only had three length variables (40cm, 50cm, 60cm) and the effluent of longer tube settlers were unknown.

The Summer 2018 Team observed that at higher upflow velocities, the floc blanket was much more dense at the top of the recirculator than at the bottom. They proposed that the Fall 2018 team design a recycle line to allow for flocs at the top of the recirculator to flow back to the bottom and re-establish a more uniform districution. This observation is what motivated the goal of the current team, which is to design that recycle line and test the new apparatus.
