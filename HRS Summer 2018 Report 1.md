#High Rate Sedimentation, Summer 2018
#### Hannah Si and Anna Hong
#### June 29, 2018

## Abstract
Since Spring 2018, the AguaClara High Rate Sedimentation (HRS) team has been investigating the cause behind floc blanket decay in the sedimentation tank, which has been attributed to system failure at high upflow velocities. At first, the Summer 2018 HRS team conducted experiments at lower upflow velocities of 1 mm/s and 2 mm/s to replicate system success. However, having discovered that floc blanket formation seems to not form at these lower velocities at all, the Summer 2018 HRS team has focused their experiments at the higher upflow velocity of 3 mm/s.

Sedimentation is a critical process for water treatment plants. It is the process by which coagulated minerals, dirt, and other particles are removed from the water via gravitational settling. The HRS team hopes to design a tank that will yield an effluent of 0.3 NTU or lower while maintaining high upflow velocity. While the World Health Organization has a standard of at most 1 NTU for drinking water, the EPA standard is 0.3 NTU. AguaClara currently achieves this with an upflow velocity of 1 mm/s, but not at upflow velocities of 3 mm/s or greater. A larger upflow velocity would allow for a reduction in treatment plant size, which would reduce construction costs among other advantages. Therefore, the goal of the HRS team is to investigate how to preserve system success at higher upflow velocities.

### Experiments and Results

The HRS team has been experimenting with two sedimentation tank designs in an effort to understand the reasons for floc blanket decay in the Spring 2018 and Fall 2017 semesters.

1. **Sedimentation tank A** is the sedimentation tank design used by most AguaClara particle removal research teams, including the HRS team in the Fall 2017 semester. The tube settler is relatively short and the floc weir is placed on the left side of the tube settler.

###Summary of Previous Experiments
| Experiment # | Description           |Results|
|:---------------:| :-------------------- |:------|
|   1   | Shorter experiment that ran at a 3 mm/s upflow velocity using tank A to record initial observations of floc blanket formation and decay|Success. Effluent turbidity did not exceed 2.0 NTU and formation of a healthy floc blanket.
|   2   | Longer experiment that ran at a 3 mm/s upflow velocity using tank B to record initial observations of floc blanket formation and decay|Partial success. Effluent turbidity stayed quite low (4.4 NTU) but increased to 19.5 NTU as time progressed.
|   3   | Longer experiment that ran at a 1 mm/s upflow velocity using tank B with initial excess coagulant| Failure. Effluent turbidity began at 4.6 NTU and rapidly increased throughout the duration of the experiment. It is hypothesized that the excess coagulant may be the cause of failure.
|   4   | Experiment 3 with appropriate coagulant dosage from the beginning | Failure. Effluent turbidity rose to 20 NTU and there was no observable formation of a floc blanket. Disproves hypothesis that initial excess coagulant caused system failure. It is now hypothesized that the upflow velocity of 1 mm/s is too slow.
|   5   | Rerun Experiment 1 with 3 mm/s upflow velocity using tank A to confirm that changes we made to our experimental apparatus is not the cause of system failure.| Failure. Effluent turbidity ended at 26 NTU after 18 hours of experimentation. Floc blanket formation occurred later than it had before in Experiment 1.
|   6   |Shorter experiment that ran at a 1 mm/s upflow velocity using tank A, which was increased to 2 mm/s about 2 hours after the start of experimentation.| Failure. Effluent turbidity ended at 46 NTU and this was after increasing the upflow velocity to 2 mm/s. These results suggest that 2 mm/s may still be too slow for system success.
###Summary of New Experiments


#### Experiment 1

<!--I would encourage you to add any photos or videos you've collected during these experiments.  A picture is worth a thousand words! -->

<!--I would also add graphs of ProCoDa data collected, primarily effluent turbidity.  This will provide much better understanding and allow readers to make their own conclusions.  This should be done through Python using the aguaclara_research code. -->
**Description**: The purpose of the first two experiments is to record initial observations of floc blanket formation and decay using both sedimentation tank designs. For Experiment 1, the HRS apparatus was run at an upflow velocity of 3 mm/s for 9.5 hours using tank A in order to confirm whether this higher rate would lead to floc blanket decay causing system failure.

**Results**: At about two and a half hours into the experiment, an opaque floc blanket has formed in the recirculator. By the end of this shorter experiment, the effluent turbidity did not rise above 2.0 NTU, making this a success. Whether this success was due to the floc weir being in an optimal position or having a more robust system will need to be further investigated. One key observation in the recirculator was more kinetic energy on the right side of the recirculator and in the region just below the bend of the sedimentation tank. This observation may be due to the combined weight of the flocs collected in the tube settler having a greater settling velocity than the upflow velocity of 3 mm/s. Throughout the bulk of the recirculator region, turbulent flow is observed to travel in a sinuous fashion.

From the observations of this experiment, the Summer 2018 HRS team has formulated a hypothesis for floc blanket decay. Due to turbulent flow inside the recirculator, the longer a particle falls, the more likely it is that it will be caught in an upward current of water. Even though particles tend to fall on the tube settler (left) side of the recirculator and rise on the other (right) side, the upward currents inside the tube (perhaps caused by gravity and/or the presence of flocs) weave side to side in turbulent flow, making it possible for falling flocs to collide with and push down rising flocs, and more significantly, rising currents to capture falling flocs. This may be the cause of floc accumulation at the top of the blanket.
<!--The image you made on the whiteboard explained this very well, try to recreate it! -->

####Experiment 2
**Description**: Experiment 2 ran a test with an upflow velocity of 3 mm/s using tank B at a longer time (22.5 hours). This test would help confirm whether the sedimentation tank design plays a factor in floc blanket decay and thus system failure.

**Results**: At the same time when Experiment 1 ended (9.5 hours), the effluent turbidity reached 4.4 NTU. Movement of flocs at this time was slower than that observed in tank A and the floc blanket was not opaque. Since these observations seemed to be characteristic of  earlier stages of floc blanket formation and decay, the experiment was prolonged to 22.5 hours. By the end of this experiment, system failure was observed with a final effluent turbidity of 19.5 NTU. This slower decay may be due to using a more robust system. Nonetheless, this experiment was concluded to be a partial success.

####Experiment 3
**Description**: The next set of experiments were done at a slower upflow velocity in order to simulate and confirm system success observed at AguaClara treatment plants. This experiment tested a 1 mm/s upflow velocity using tank B. For the first 30 minutes, there was an input of excess coagulant because the coagulant pump speed was not reduced from 20 RPM to 6.7 RPM to reflect this lower upflow velocity.

**Results**: The initial effluent turbidity began at 4.6 NTU and increased throughout the duration of the experiment quite rapidly. By the end of 20 hours, the effluent turbidity was higher than influent turbidity at 135 NTU, making this a failure. It was hypothesized that the influx of large amounts of coagulant at the beginning of the experiment caused coagulant to stick to the walls, causing higher shear and decreased diameter. Coagulant particles may be colliding with other coagulant particles instead of clay particles, which only form small flocs. These small particles are more difficult to capture and thus travel upwards to the tube settler and out in the effluent tube.

####Experiment 4
**Description**: To nullify any potential effects from the initial coagulant dosage spike in Experiment 3, this experiment ran at 1 mm/s with the appropriate coagulant pump speed of 6.7 RPM for 8 hours.

**Results**: With a final effluent turbidity of 20 NTU, system failure was observed, disproving that initial excess coagulant was the cause. There was no observable formation of a floc blanket, which means that the smaller flocs that were contaminating the effluent were not being captured and settled out. One key observation was that there seemed to be a gradual increase in floc size within the flocculator as it neared its end. However, the unusually clear sedimentation tank raises the question as to where these bigger flocs ended up going. Since excess coagulant does not seem to be preventing floc blanket formation and that the larger flocs from the flocculator seem to have disappeared, it is hypothesized that the upflow velocity of 1 mm/s is too slow.

####Experiment 5
**Description**: To make sure that the changes that we made to our experimental apparatus is not the cause of system failure, Experiment 1 was rerun but for a longer period of 18 hours. <!--Restate the specifics for experiment 1 (tube settler used, etc.) -->

**Results**: As before, an opaque floc blanket formed with the same density gradient of flocs in the recirculator (higher density of flocs at the top compared to the bottom). However, this experiment ended with a slowly rising effluent turbidity of 26 NTU at 18 hours. There were many flocs settled in the tube settler, which may have reached there before the formation of the floc blanket. It seems that the floc blanket formed later than it had before in Experiment 1, allowing the smaller flocs that are more difficult to capture travel up to the tube settler and out the effluent tube. This much higher effluent turbidity suggests that something has changed since Experiment 1, but whether the design of the system was the change has yet to be determined.

####Experiment 6
**Description**: Since Experiment 1 was a success at an upflow velocity of 3 mm/s, it was predicted that running the same experiment at a lower upflow velocity of 1 mm/s would also be a success. About 2 hours after the start of the experiment, there was still no signs of floc blanket formation. Therefore, the water and coagulant pump speeds were increased to reflect a 2 mm/s upflow velocity to test the hypothesis that upflow velocity was too slow as formulated after Experiment 4.

**Results**: Ending with an effluent turbidity of 46 NTU, this experiment observed system failure. No floc blanket formed throughout the duration of the experiment even with the increased speeds. While it seemed that there could be a speed too slow for this system to succeed, these results suggest that a different factor is causing system failure.

<!-- Where did you end up with tank A vs. tank B?  It might be worth adding a paragraph discussing these, how flocs are removed in each, and how that might change effluent turbidity-->

###Future Work
The cause of floc blanket decay and thus system failure has yet to be determined. Future work will focus on verifying pump speed calculations for the water pump. Coagulant dosage will be experimentally adjusted in order to obtain the formation of a floc blanket. More immediately, experiments running at an upflow velocity of 2 mm/s will be tested with a lower coagulant dosage. <!--How are you planning on updating coagulant dosing? Trial and error or through calculations?-->

###Calculations
We have written code in Python for calculating the system flow rate, water pump speed, coagulant concentration, and coagulant pump speed given an upflow velocity and other parameters.<!--Are functions to do this available in aguaclara_research?  If not consider adding them, as these would be generally applicable to most particle removal teams -->

The calculations in the "Current coagulant dosage calculations" section of our code differ from those of previous HRS teams in that the coagulant pump speed is the quotient of the desired flow rate of coagulant (mL/s) divided by the volume pumped per revolution by the coagulant pump (mL/rev), rather than the desired flow rate of coagulant (mL/s) divided by the flow rate of the coagulant pump (mL/s).

We now also use a similar calculation for water pump speed using values for volume per revolution given by the tubing's specifications, in place of obtaining them experimentally. (Volume per revolution was previously obtained by measuring water output in a set amount of time.)

See the equations below for clarification.

$S$ = pump speed
$Q$ = flow rate
$V$ = volume per revolution

$$S\ \frac{rev}{min} = \frac{Q\ \frac{mL}{min}}{V\ \frac{mL}{rev}}$$

### Other Insights
**Spiking influent turbidity**
The influent turbidity seems to spike upwards when we start the coagulant pump, even when the coagulant is not connected to the system or pumping coagulant. It has been suggested that the vibrations of the pump may be the cause, but we have yet to test this.

**ProCoDa method files**
Since losing our ProCoDa program settings after to a computer restart, we have decided to save snapshots of our ProCoDa setpoints and states after making any significant modifications, such as adding setpoints and variables (e.g. pressure from the pressure sensor), changing setpoint values (e.g. tuning the PID constants), and changing state logic (e.g. periodically flushing the system with a higher water pump speed).

We accomplish this by _saving a new method file_ in our datalog directory with a name corresponding to the experiment and date. The method file behaves as a "snapshot" because ProCoDa continues to read and write its program settings to one particular method file in the `C:\ProCoDa Data` directory, usually `ProCoDa 0.pcm` (0 may be replaced with another number), while leaving the manually uploaded method file untouched.

The past method files stored on the HRS computer and our current method file have been saved to our Github repository.

**Sedimentation tank leaks**
If it appears that water is leaking out of the sedimentation tank from where the floc weir was welded to the recirculator or tube settler, you will need to re-weld the connection.

To identify the exact source(s) of the leaking, it is recommended to fill the sedimentation tank with water mixed with dye and dry the exterior of the tank so that any new beads of liquid that emerge are easily detected. You can also dry the exterior, press a dry paper towel against the area of leakage, and match any wet spots on the paper towel to sources of leakage on the tank.
