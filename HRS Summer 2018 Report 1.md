#High Rate Sedimentation, Summer 2018
#### Hannah Si and Anna Hong
#### June 29, 2018

##Abstract
Since Spring 2018, the AguaClara High Rate Sedimentation team has been investigating the cause behind floc blanket decay in the sedimentation tank, which has been attributed to system failure at high upflow velocities. Along with conducting a small series of experiments, the Summer 2018 HRS team has developed a more robust experimental apparatus and clear set of instructions for setup.

##Methods
###Experimental Apparatus
Here is a picture of the revised lab bench set up of the HRS team followed by a table listing the various components.

For detailed instructions and guidelines on preparing the High Rate Sedimentation experimental setup, refer to the HRS Setup Procedures document in our Github repository. (PUT HYPERLINK)

1. Drain the sedimentation tank.

</p>

2. Clean the flocculator and sedimentation tank.

</p>

3. Clean out the pressure attenuator.

</p>

4. Disconnect the coagulant pump from system and check if coagulant is pumping through. Then reconnect it to the system.
   * Make sure the coagulant valve is open. There should be steady droplets of solution.

5. Run water through the system while bypassing the pressure attenuator.

</p>

6. After the water reaches the top of the sed tank, shut off the water pump and drain the sed tank again.
   * Repeat steps 5 and 6 to achieve a more thorough cleaning of the sed tank.

7. Run water only through the system with the pressure attenuator included until effluent turbidity stabilizes near 0 NTU (ideally below 1.0 NTU).

8. Clean out the influent and effluent turbidimeters.

</p>

9. Direct the flow to waste instead of the flocculator.

10. Turn the clay stirrer and ProCoDa on.

11. Stabilize influent turbidity to 100 NTU.

12. Redirect the flow back to the flocculator and main system. Turn on the coagulant pump to start the experiment.
