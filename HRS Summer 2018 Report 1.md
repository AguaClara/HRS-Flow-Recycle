#High Rate Sedimentation, Summer 2018
#### Hannah Si and Anna Hong
#### June 29, 2018

##Abstract
Since Spring 2018, the AguaClara Flocculation-Sedimentation Filtration team has been investigating the cause behind floc blanket decay in the sedimentation tank, leading to system failure. Along with conducting a small series of experiments, the Summer 2018 HRS team has developed a more robust experimental apparatus and clear set of instructions during setup.

##Methods
###Experimental Apparatus
Here is a picture of the revised lab bench set up of the HRS team followed by a table listing the various components.

1. Drain the sedimentation tank

2. Clean the flocculator and sedimentation tank

3. Clean out the pressure attenuator

4. Disconnect coagulant pump from system and check if coagulant is pumping through correctly. Make sure the coagulant valve is open.There should be steady droplets of solution. Reconnect to the system.

5. Run water through the system while bypassing the pressure attenuator

6. After the water reaches the top of the sed tank, shut off the water pump and drain the sed tank again. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to achieve a more thorough cleaning of the sed tank.
7. Run water only through the system with the pressure attenuator until effluent turbidity stabilizes near 0 NTU

8. Clean out the influent and effluent turbidimeters

9. Redirect flow to waste instead of the flocculator.
10. Turn the clay stirrer and ProCoDa on.
11. Stabilize influent turbidity to 100 NTU.

12. Connect coagulant tubing back to main system and run experiment.
