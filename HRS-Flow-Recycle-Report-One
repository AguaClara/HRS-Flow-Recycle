## Abstract
Previous High Rate Sedimentation (HRS) teams have observed that at higher upflow velocities, the floc blanket is much more dense at the top of the recirculator than at the bottom. Because of this, they have hypothesized that installing a recycle line from the top of the recirculator to the bottom of the recirculator will improve floc blanket longevity and increase overall reactor performance. The Fall 2018 team has run a baseline experiments, and has begun to fabricate the flow recycle system. In the future, the team will test the recycle system at varying angles of entry into the recirculator and at various upflow velocities.

## Introduction
Sedimentation is the process through which coagulated contaminant particles are removed from water via gravitational settling. In a sedimentation tank, water flows upward as the flocs settle downward. Those flocs settle into a "floc blanket" at the bottom of the sedimentation tank. A floc blanket is defined as a fluidized bed of suspended solids with a high rate of collisions. The particles in the floc blanket begin as small, particles continue to collide with coagulant particles and other flocs,  they clump together into heavier and heavier flocs that will settle into the basin of the recirculator. This process cleans the water, resulting in a lower effluent NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit, a measure of clarity).

In the AguaClara lab, the sedimentation tank's plate settlers are simulated by section of plastic PVC piping called the tube settler. The secion of tube wherein the floc blanket forms is referred to as the "recirculator" by the HRS teams. Since the behavior of a section of fluid is representative of the entire tank, tubing can be used to simulate a simple pathway in the reactor. This allows for a practical method of experimentation on a smaller scale. See figure 1 for a visual comparison of the sedimentation tank in an AguaClara plant to the sedimentation tank in lab.

The HRS teams aim to design a tank that will yield an effluent of no more than 0.3 NTU while maintaining high upflow velocity. Operating at a higher upflow velocity will allow us to process more water in a given period of time, which will decrease plant operating costs. However, when operating at a high upflow velocity in lab, the floc blanket is unstable. The floc blanket is dense near the top of the recirculator, but very thin near the bottom. HRS: Flow Recycle hopes to remediate this issue by installing a recycle line. This will allow future teams to continue researching the potential viability of high upflow velocities in AguaClara plants.
